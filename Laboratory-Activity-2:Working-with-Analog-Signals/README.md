# Laboratory Activity #2
## Working with Analog Signals

### Course
COSC 111 – Internet of Things

### Objective
The objective of this laboratory activity is to understand how analog signals are read and processed using an Arduino microcontroller. This activity focuses on learning how varying input values, such as voltage levels, can be interpreted and used to control output behavior in embedded and IoT systems.

### Description
In this activity, analog signals are explored using components such as sensors or variable resistors (e.g., potentiometers). The Arduino reads continuous voltage values through its analog input pins and converts them into digital values using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). These values are then used to control outputs such as LED brightness using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

This activity helps demonstrate the difference between digital and analog signals and shows how real-world analog inputs can be integrated into digital systems commonly used in IoT applications.

### Tools / Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno or compatible Arduino board
- Arduino IDE
- Breadboard
- Analog input device (e.g., potentiometer or sensor)
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

### Output
The expected output of this activity is a responsive system where changes in the analog input result in varying output behavior, such as smoothly increasing or decreasing LED brightness. This demonstrates real-time analog signal processing and control.
