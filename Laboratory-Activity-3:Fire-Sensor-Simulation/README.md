# Laboratory Activity #3
## Working with Fire Sensors

### Course
COSC 111 – Internet of Things

### Objective
The objective of this laboratory activity is to understand how fire sensors are used to detect the presence of flames or high heat levels and how their digital output signals can be processed by an Arduino microcontroller to trigger safety responses.

### Description
In this activity, a fire sensor module is interfaced with an Arduino to detect the presence of flame or intense heat. The sensor outputs a digital signal that changes state when fire is detected. The Arduino reads this signal and uses conditional logic to activate an alert device such as an LED or buzzer.

This activity demonstrates the practical application of digital signal processing in safety and monitoring systems. It also highlights how sensor-based input can be used to make real-time decisions in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

### Tools / Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno or compatible Arduino board
- Arduino IDE
- Fire sensor (flame sensor module)
- LED or buzzer for alert indication
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Output
The expected output of this activity is a system that continuously monitors for the presence of fire. When a flame or high heat source is detected, the alert device is activated. When no fire is detected, the alert remains off.
