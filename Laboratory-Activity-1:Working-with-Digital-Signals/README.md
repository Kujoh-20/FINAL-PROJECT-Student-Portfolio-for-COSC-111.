# Laboratory Activity #1
## Working with Digital Signals

### Course
COSC 111 – Internet of Things

---

### Objective
The objective of this laboratory activity is to understand and demonstrate the behavior of basic digital signals by controlling multiple output devices using an Arduino microcontroller. This activity aims to familiarize students with binary states (HIGH and LOW), digital output pin configuration, and timing control using software delays.

---

### Description
In this laboratory activity, digital signals are applied to control a sequence of LEDs connected to an Arduino board. Each LED represents a digital output that operates in two states: ON (HIGH) and OFF (LOW). The program sequentially turns the LEDs ON and OFF with a fixed time delay, allowing the user to visually observe signal transitions and timing behavior.

This activity reinforces fundamental concepts of digital electronics, such as discrete signal levels, sequential logic, and real-time control, which are essential in Internet of Things (IoT) systems and embedded applications.

### Tools / Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible Arduino board)
- Arduino IDE
- Breadboard
- Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
- Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω)
- Jumper wires

### Output
The expected output of this activity is a sequence where five LEDs light up one by one with a one-second interval between each LED. After all LEDs are turned ON, they are turned OFF in the same sequence. This process repeats continuously, demonstrating controlled digital signal output and timing.

### Learning Outcomes
By completing this laboratory activity, the student is able to:
- Configure Arduino digital pins as output
- Understand the difference between HIGH and LOW digital states
- Implement delays to control signal timing
- Apply basic sequential logic in a microcontroller program
- Interpret digital signal behavior through visual output
